Business analysis platform to do great job

## Build a web tool application so a business analyst can document the projectâ€™s requirements in an ordered way according to a given methodology.

Requirements => BPMN => User Stories & Tasks => Wireframes

**One of the main goals of the system is to assure that the stakeholders accept and agree with the documentation registered in the platform.**

* Requirements: Functional and Non-Functional.
* BPM: Basic business logic in business process notation.
* User Stories: Role + Want + So that + Acceptance Criteria (Gherkins) + Conditions and restrictions.
* Tasks: A needed activity to accomplish the goals of the project.
* Wireframes: Basic wireframing.

*The system should show warnings or errors when the methodology is being done in a wrong way.*

Another important feature is to have a very efficient and graphical way to access all information related within a project.

The system should provide an easy and practical way to write basic BPM diagrams, like the very basic functionality of drawing squares, lines and text like a Google Draw document. 

All requirements, bpmn, user stories, tasks and wireframes should be at first glance for the user, so they can be easily accessed within the platform.

**The system must be written in clean architecture and code.**

* Front-End should be coded in Next.JS w/typescript.
* Business Logic: should be code in Python.
* Back-End should be coded in Django.
